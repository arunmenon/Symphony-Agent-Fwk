Explore the taxonomy tree for {{root_category}} with initial categories: {{initial_categories}}

Your task:
1. FIRST: For each category, use search_subcategories and search_category_info tools to gather up-to-date information
2. Examine each category in depth, comparing your knowledge with search results
3. Identify and validate subcategories through both knowledge base and external search
4. Research compliance and regulatory considerations using search tools
5. For each category and subcategory, enrich the following fields:
   - description: A concise explanation of what this category encompasses
   - enforcement_examples: Real-world examples of enforcement challenges or actions
   - social_media_trends: Current or emerging trends related to this category online
   - risk_level: Assessment of potential risk (High, Medium, Low)
   - detection_methods: Approaches for identifying this category
6. Ensure comprehensive coverage by combining internal knowledge with search results

IMPORTANT: You MUST use the following search tools for accurate, current information:
- search_knowledge_base("{{category}}")
- search_subcategories("{{category}}")
- search_category_info("{{category}}", "compliance")

Focus on depth, breadth, and accuracy while exploring the taxonomy structure. Prefer search-based information over internal knowledge when there are conflicts. Your exploration should be domain-agnostic - don't make assumptions specific to particular industries unless they're part of the category definition.
