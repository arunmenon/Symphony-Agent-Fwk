Create a comprehensive taxonomy for {{root_category}}. 

Your task:
1. FIRST: Use the search_subcategories and search_category_info tools to gather current, authoritative information about {{root_category}}
2. Research and identify the main categories within {{root_category}}
3. Organize these into a logical hierarchical structure
4. Include important subcategories for each main category
5. For each category, provide:
   - A brief description of the category
   - Typical enforcement examples or challenges
   - Social media trends related to this category
   - Relative risk level (High, Medium, Low)
   - Common detection methods
6. Consider regulatory and compliance aspects for each category - use search tools for the latest regulatory information

IMPORTANT: You MUST use search tools at least once to ensure your taxonomy contains up-to-date and accurate information. Do this by calling:
- search_subcategories("{{root_category}}") for finding current subcategories
- search_category_info("{{root_category}}", "compliance") for compliance-related information

Focus on creating a well-structured hierarchical taxonomy that addresses regulatory compliance needs and could be further expanded. Your taxonomy should be comprehensive but adaptable to any domain - avoid making assumptions specific to particular industries unless those are part of the root category definition.
