# Symphony API Design

This document explains the architectural patterns used in the Symphony API design and how they improve developer experience.

## Overview

Symphony uses a combination of architectural patterns to provide a clean, intuitive API while maintaining the flexibility and power of the underlying components:

1. **Registry Pattern**: Used internally to manage services and dependencies
2. **Facade Pattern**: Provides domain-specific interfaces that hide implementation details
3. **Builder Pattern**: Offers fluent interfaces for creating complex objects
4. **Unified API**: Exposes all functionality through a centralized entry point

## Registry Pattern

The Registry Pattern serves as the internal backbone of Symphony, providing:

- Centralized service management
- Dependency injection
- Component lifecycle management

While powerful, the Registry Pattern exposes implementation details to developers, making the API less intuitive. This is why we've implemented additional patterns on top of it.

## Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern provides domain-specific interfaces that:

- Hide implementation details
- Expose only relevant functionality
- Simplify complex operations

Symphony implements facades for:

- **Workflows**: Creating, managing, and executing workflows
- **Agents**: Creating and configuring agents
- **Tasks**: Creating and executing tasks

Example usage:

```python
# Create and save an agent using the facade
agent_config = await symphony.agents.create_agent(
    name="WriterAgent",
    role="Content Writer",
    instruction_template="You are a creative content writer who excels at generating engaging content.",
    capabilities={"expertise": ["writing", "content", "creativity"]}
)
agent_id = await symphony.agents.save_agent(agent_config)
```

## Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern provides fluent interfaces for creating complex objects:

- Method chaining improves readability
- Makes constructing complex objects more intuitive
- Reduces the chance of configuration errors

Symphony implements builders for:

- **Workflows**: Creating complex workflow definitions
- **Agents**: Configuring agent capabilities and properties
- **Tasks**: Setting up task parameters and inputs

Example usage:

```python
# Create an agent using the builder pattern
agent = (symphony.build_agent()
         .create("AnalystAgent", "Data Analyst", 
               "You are a data analyst who excels at interpreting and analyzing data.")
         .with_capabilities(["analysis", "data", "statistics"])
         .with_model("gpt-4")
         .with_metadata("description", "Specialized in data analysis and visualization")
         .build())
```

## Unified API

The main Symphony class serves as a centralized entry point for all functionality:

- Provides consistent access to all components
- Handles setup and configuration
- Offers both facade and builder interfaces

Example usage:

```python
# Initialize Symphony
symphony = Symphony()
await symphony.setup()

# Access facade interfaces
workflow = await symphony.workflows.create_workflow("My Workflow")

# Access builder interfaces
task = symphony.build_task().create("My Task", "Description").build()
```

## Design Benefits

This multi-layered approach offers several benefits:

1. **Progressive disclosure**: Simple operations are easy, complex operations are possible
2. **Flexibility**: Developers can choose the approach that works best for them
3. **Maintainability**: Implementation details can change without affecting the public API
4. **Readability**: Code using the API is more self-documenting and readable
5. **Type safety**: All interfaces are strongly typed for better IDE support

## Extending the Architecture

When extending Symphony:

1. Add implementation details to core components
2. Update appropriate facade interfaces to expose new functionality
3. Update builder interfaces if needed for creating new objects
4. Ensure the main Symphony class exposes the new functionality

This approach ensures that new features follow the same architectural patterns and provide a consistent developer experience.
