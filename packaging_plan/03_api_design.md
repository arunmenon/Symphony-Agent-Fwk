# 3. API Design and Documentation

## Current Analysis
Symphony has a good API foundation with the main Symphony class and facades, but needs more comprehensive documentation and standardization.

## Action Items

### 3.1 API Standardization
- Define clear API contracts for each component
- Use Protocol classes for interface definitions
- Establish consistent return types and error handling
- Add comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase

### 3.2 Module Exports
- Define explicit `__all__` lists in all modules
- Create layered imports (from core to advanced features)
- Implement lazy imports for expensive components
- Add import examples to documentation

### 3.3 API Stability Markers
- Mark API stability status with decorators:
  - `@stable` - Stable APIs with backward compatibility guarantees
  - `@experimental` - Experimental APIs that may change
  - `@deprecated` - APIs scheduled for removal with migration path
- Add version information to APIs for tracking

### 3.4 Comprehensive API Documentation
- Generate API reference with docstrings
- Implement Google-style docstrings throughout
- Create interactive API examples
- Add cross-references between related components

### 3.5 Facade Enhancements
- Review and enhance all Facades for consistency
- Ensure all public methods have clean signatures
- Add missing functionality to facades
- Document facade patterns and usage

## Implementation Goals
- Intuitive, discoverable API
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Consistent error handling
- Self-documenting interfaces
