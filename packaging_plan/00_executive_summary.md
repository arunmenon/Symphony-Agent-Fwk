# Symphony Packaging Strategy: Executive Summary

## Project Goals
Transform Symphony from a framework under development to a production-ready, distributable Python package suitable for both library usage and application development.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Professional Python Package**
   - Complete packaging with pyproject.toml
   - Clear public APIs and proper module organization
   - Comprehensive typing and documentation

2. **User-Friendly Installation**
   - Simple pip installation
   - Logical optional dependency groups
   - Multiple distribution channels

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Progressive disclosure from basics to advanced
   - Interactive examples and tutorials
   - Comprehensive API reference

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Extensive test coverage
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Static analysis and type checking

5. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture
   - Well-defined extension points
   - Developer documentation

## Implementation Strategy

We've divided the implementation into five strategic phases:

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Package structure refinement
   - Dependency management
   - Basic infrastructure

2. **API and Documentation** (Weeks 3-4)
   - API standardization
   - Documentation system
   - Usage examples

3. **Testing and Quality** (Weeks 5-6)
   - Test coverage expansion
   - Quality gates
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Distribution and Extensibility** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Distribution setup
   - Plugin system
   - Release automation

5. **Launch and Community** (Weeks 9-10)
   - Final preparations
   - Community setup
   - Launch activities

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Begin package structure refinement
2. Complete dependency categorization
3. Set up documentation framework
4. Create prototype of enhanced API
