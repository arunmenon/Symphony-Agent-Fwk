# Symphony Packaging Plan

This directory contains the comprehensive packaging plan for transforming Symphony into a production-ready, distributable Python package.

## Plan Structure

1. [**Executive Summary**](00_executive_summary.md) - High-level overview of the packaging strategy
2. [**Package Structure**](01_package_structure.md) - Package organization and directory structure
3. [**Dependency Management**](02_dependency_management.md) - Managing core and optional dependencies
4. [**API Design**](03_api_design.md) - Clean, consistent API design and documentation
5. [**Documentation System**](04_documentation_system.md) - Comprehensive documentation strategy
6. [**Testing and Quality**](05_testing_and_quality.md) - Testing, quality assurance, and CI/CD
7. [**Distribution and Release**](06_distribution_and_release.md) - Versioning, distribution, and release processes
8. [**Extensibility**](07_extensibility.md) - Plugin system and extension points
9. [**Implementation Plan**](08_implementation_plan.md) - Phased implementation approach
10. [**Plugin Integration**](09_plugin_integration.md) - Integrating the plugin system
11. [**Entry Points**](10_entry_points.md) - Entry point configuration for extensibility
12. [**Implementation Progress**](implementation_progress.md) - Current implementation status

## Implementation Status

The packaging plan is currently in Phase 1: Foundation. See [implementation_progress.md](implementation_progress.md) for details on completed and pending tasks.

## Key Changes Implemented

1. Enhanced pyproject.toml with comprehensive metadata and dependency organization
2. Improved API structure with explicit exports and feature detection
3. Updated plugin system with entry point discovery and dependency management
4. Added CLI entry point and command structure
5. Created systematic documentation framework

## Next Steps

1. Complete Symphony API integration with the plugin system
2. Add missing __init__.py files and __all__ declarations
3. Implement feature detection for all optional components
4. Begin documentation system implementation

## Using This Plan

This plan serves as both a roadmap and a reference for the Symphony packaging process. Developers should follow these guidelines to ensure consistent implementation:

1. Follow the phased approach outlined in the implementation plan
2. Refer to specific component guides when implementing features
3. Update the implementation progress as tasks are completed
4. Adhere to the API design principles for consistency
