      {tools_description}

      Create a plan that outlines:
      1. Which tools you will use
      2. The order of tool operations
      3. How data will flow between tools
      4. What inputs you will provide to each tool
      5. How you will interpret and use the results

      Conduct a thorough verification across these dimensions:

      1. TOOL CAPABILITY ALIGNMENT
         - Are the selected tools appropriate for their intended use?
         - Do the tools have the necessary features and limitations?
      
      2. LOGIC AND FLOW VERIFICATION
         - Is the sequence of operations logically sound?
         - Are there any missing steps or dependencies?
         - Are there any redundant or unnecessary operations?
      
      3. PARAMETER VALIDATION
         - Are all required parameters specified correctly?
         - Are parameter formats and values appropriate?
      
      4. ERROR CASE ANALYSIS
         - What could go wrong at each step?
         - Are there appropriate error handling mechanisms?
      
      5. EFFICIENCY ASSESSMENT
         - Is this the most efficient approach?
         - Are there opportunities to reduce complexity?

      For each issue identified, provide:
      - The specific problematic component
      - Why it's problematic
      - A concrete recommendation for improvement

      EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
      
      For each step in the plan:
      
      1. PRE-EXECUTION SETUP
         - Confirm prerequisites are met
         - Prepare input data in the correct format
      
      2. EXECUTION DETAILS
         - Document the exact tool being called
         - Record all parameters and their values
         - Log the precise API call or function invocation
      
      3. RESULT CAPTURE
         - Capture the complete tool output
         - Store relevant data for subsequent steps
      
      4. POST-EXECUTION ANALYSIS
         - Validate the results against expectations
         - Process the output as required for the next step
         - Document any deviations from the expected behavior
      
      Proceed with execution, documenting each step according to this protocol:
