"""Example demonstrating domain-specific importance assessment strategies for memory.

This example showcases Symphony's specialized domain-specific memory importance strategies, 
which determine how agent memory systems prioritize information. Different agent types 
(customer support, educational, medical, etc.) have different requirements for what's 
considered important information to remember.

Key concepts demonstrated:
1. Domain-specific strategy creation and configuration
2. Importance assessment of different messages in context
3. Storage location determination based on importance scores
4. Comparative analysis of how different domains assess the same message
5. Memory tier selection (working memory, long-term, knowledge graph)

The domain strategies improve agent memory capabilities by encoding domain expertise
into the memory system, ensuring the most relevant information is retained for each
agent's specific purpose and context.
