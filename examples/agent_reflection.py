To solve this problem, I'll calculate how many apples each person gets.
We have 10 apples and 3 people. Each person should get an equal number of apples.
10 divided by 3 equals 3, so each person gets 3 apples.
That means a total of 9 apples are distributed, and we have 1 apple left over.
"""

    reflection_on_flawed = """
REFLECTION:
The reasoning contains a mathematical error. The calculation of 10 divided by 3 is incorrect. 10 divided by 3 is not exactly 3, but approximately 3.33. In the context of distributing whole apples, we need to consider that we can only give whole apples to each person.

Also, the reasoning correctly identifies that if each person gets 3 apples, then 9 apples are distributed in total with 1 left over. However, it doesn't address what to do with the remaining apple.

IMPROVED REASONING:
To solve this problem, I'll calculate how many apples each person gets.
We have 10 apples and 3 people. Each person should get an equal number of apples.
10 divided by 3 equals 3 with a remainder of 1, which means each person gets 3 whole apples.
That means a total of 9 apples are distributed (3 apples Ã— 3 people = 9 apples), and we have 1 apple left over.
We can either leave this apple undistributed, or we could cut it into 3 equal parts so each person gets an additional 1/3 of an apple, depending on the requirements of the problem.

REFLECTION:
The plan for organizing a birthday party is very basic and lacks important details and considerations. It doesn't include timing elements (when to do each task), budget considerations, or specifics about what needs to be done within each step. Several critical elements are also missing, such as food/drinks beyond the cake, music/entertainment, and cleanup.

IMPROVED REASONING:
Plan for organizing a small birthday party:

1. Planning (1-2 weeks before):
   - Decide on date, time, guest list, and budget
   - Choose a theme and location
   - Send invitations with RSVP details

2. Shopping (3-5 days before):
   - Purchase decorations (balloons, banners, themed items)
   - Buy ingredients for cake and other food
   - Get beverages (considering preferences of guests)
   - Purchase party favors if desired

3. Food preparation (1 day before):
   - Bake cake or order from bakery
   - Prepare any food that can be made ahead of time
   - Confirm dietary restrictions of guests

4. Setup (day of party):
   - Arrange furniture as needed
   - Set up decorations
   - Prepare remaining food and drinks
   - Set up music/entertainment

5. During party:
   - Welcome guests
   - Serve food and drinks
   - Facilitate activities or games
   - Cake ceremony (singing, candles, etc.)

6. After party:
   - Thank guests as they leave
   - Clean up venue
   - Send thank-you messages next day
